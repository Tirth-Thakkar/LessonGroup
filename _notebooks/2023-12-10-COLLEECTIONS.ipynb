    "### What are collections?\n",
    "Collections are any group of individual objects that are represented as a single unit is known as a Java Collection of Objects. In Java, a separate framework named the “Collection Framework” has been defined in JDK 1.2 which holds all the Java Collection Classes and Interface in it. It works as an interface that defines the highest-level of shared collection behavior, and extends Iterable which allows usage of ForEach loop.\n",
