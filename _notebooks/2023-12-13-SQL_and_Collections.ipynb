In other words, each entity on one side of the relationship can be associated with multiple entities on the other side, and vice versa.\n",

    "- ManyToOne Relationship\n",
    "    - In the context of a relational database, a many-to-one relationship typically means that multiple instances of one entity (the \"many\" side) are associated with a single instance of another entity (the \"one\" side).\n",
    "    - The tag being assigned to Notes indicates that it is the many side, so multiple notes can be attributed to one Person object but a note can only be associated with a single Person object.\n",
