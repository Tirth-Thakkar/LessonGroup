It acts as the backbone for many of this class's project backends, allowing users to create, read, update and delete data efficiently. To get a better idea of how data is formatted with JPA to be stored in an SQL database, we'll be looking at the `Person` object in the lesson backend. Follow along in this notebook.\n",
